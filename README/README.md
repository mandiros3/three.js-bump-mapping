## Comments ##

**Why I chose these resources**

three.js was chosen because it's a very popular platform with a lot of documentation. It hides all the low level operations, which helps  focus better on implementing the scene.

**The extent to which I used them**

Most of the code, it pretty generic, most of it was found from the documentation of the library. The rest was straightforward, it was merely a question of expanding it to find the goals set.

**Limitations and problems**

I wanted to paint a sky texture, but it took too long to load. It was also hard to find a good texture that could be repeated without and seams or obvious gaps.

**Goodies**

Interactivity was implemented. It's possible to navigate around the scene with these 
controls:
    
	* Rotate: Drag with left mouse button
	* Zoom: Use scrollwheel
	* Pan: Drag with right mouse button
